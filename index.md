# About

With a Master of Science degree in Gravity and Cosmology, my research interests revolve around various areas including Accretion Disks, Active Galactic Nuclei, Dark Energy and Dark Matter, Black Hole Cosmology, Epoch of Re-ionization, and Negative Mass Cosmology. As a Research Assistant with over two years of experience, my focus is on pushing the boundaries of knowledge through innovative research in the field of cosmology.
