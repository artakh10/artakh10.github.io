# About

I am Arta Khosravi, a passionate researcher in the field of gravity and cosmology. With a Master of Science degree in this fascinating domain, my research interests span across various intriguing topics, including Accretion Disks, Active Galactic Nuclei, Dark Energy and Dark Matter, Black Hole Cosmology, Epoch of Re-ionization, and Negative Mass Cosmology.

Currently, I am fortunate to be working as a Research Assistant (RA) in the esteemed Physics Data and Astronomy Technology (PDAT) Lab. In this role, I am actively engaged in data analysis, developing innovative theoretical models, and designing experiments to test these theories. Being part of the PDAT team allows me to utilize my analytical skills, attention to detail, and creative thinking to contribute to cutting-edge research in cosmology. I am thrilled to continue exploring the mysteries of the universe and contribute to expanding our understanding of its fundamental principles.
